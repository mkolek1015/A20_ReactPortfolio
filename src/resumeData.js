    "aboutme":"I am a Graphic Artist based out of Manchester, CT. I have spent the last 19 years working in the Graphic Design field as a designer, in layout & design, print (catalogs), production and fabrication (sign making, label printing, vehicle lettering). With the recent pandemic of 2020, I decided to take the opportunity to learn a new technology and have since completed a Certification in Full-Stack Web Development from the University of Connecticut & Trilogy, where I learned ideal practices behind the design of mobile and user-friendly websites and applications. I am actively looking for a job in Web-Development where I hope to combine my newly learned skils with my Graphic Design experience and merge it into a new full-time career!",
